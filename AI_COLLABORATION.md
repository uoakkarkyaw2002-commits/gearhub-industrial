# AI Collaboration Log (Claude ⇄ Codex)

The owner gives each task to **one** agent at a time. GitHub `main` is the handoff channel.

## Rules

- Before a task: pull the latest `main`, then read `AGENTS.md` and this file.
- Do not start a task that is listed below as **assigned / in progress** for the other agent.
- Change only the assigned feature. Use the owner's screenshots as the exact design reference.
- After a task: commit and merge to `main`, add a handoff entry below, and set its status to **completed**.
- **Do not deploy.** The owner deploys on Render himself (Auto-Deploy is Off).

## In progress

_None._

## Project notes for the next agent

- Live site: https://skyshopmm.com. Seller shops live at `/shops/<slug>/` and their admin at `/shops/<slug>/admin`. The POLESTAR test shop is `psm-test-shop`.
- Run tests with **Node 22** (`npm test`). On Node 24, better-sqlite3 crashes.
- Every release bumps the version in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `public/index.html`, `public/sw.js` and `tests/tenant-install.test.js`.
- When you change a `public/*.js|css` file, update its `?v=` cache tag in `public/admin.html` (or the page that loads it).
- `main` requires a review. Merge with "Bypass rules and merge".
- Seller shops must never show the GearHub brand. Keep the seller-branding tests passing.

## Handoff entries (newest first)

### 1.1.82: Category save frees the editor at once (Claude) — completed
- Task: after **Save Categories**, Add/Save went dead until the whole page reloaded. On phones this took long, and a failed reload reported the save as failed.
- Files: `public/admin.js`, `public/admin.html`, `tests/category-save.test.js`, plus the version files.
- PR: https://github.com/uoakkarkyaw2002-commits/gearhub-industrial/pull/147
- Notes: after the PUT succeeds, `refreshAll()` runs in the background (`.catch(()=>{})`). Do not `await` it again inside the save handler.

### 1.1.81: Admins stay signed in (Claude) — completed
- Task: admins were sent back to login every 8 hours and during every deploy.
- Files: `server.js` (30-day `rolling` session, `SESSION_MAX_AGE`), `public/admin.js`, `public/tenant-admin.js` (wait up to ~2 minutes on a 5xx before showing login), `tests/stay-signed-in.test.js`.
- PR: https://github.com/uoakkarkyaw2002-commits/gearhub-industrial/pull/146
- Notes: sessions are stored in SQLite (`sessions` table), so restarts keep them.

### 1.1.80: Parent category uses the Add Product picker (Claude) — completed
- Task: in the category editor, **Parent category** now opens the same picker as Add Product instead of a native `<select>`.
- Files: `public/category-picker.js` (new `window.GearHubCategoryPicker.open({...})`), `public/admin.js`, `tests/category-parent-picker.test.js`.
- PR: https://github.com/uoakkarkyaw2002-commits/gearhub-industrial/pull/145
- Notes: options are `allowNone`, `mainSelectable` and `allowed(row)`. The Add Product behaviour (a main category can't be picked) is unchanged.

### 1.1.79: Phones tap a category to edit it (Claude) — completed
- Task: hide the ✎ button on phones (≤600px); tapping the category heading opens or closes its editor.
- Files: `public/admin.js`, `public/site-admin.css`, `tests/category-tap-edit.test.js`.
- PR: https://github.com/uoakkarkyaw2002-commits/gearhub-industrial/pull/144

### 1.1.78: Order alerts reconnect by themselves (Claude) — completed
- Task: a device with notification permission that the server no longer knows (for example, after the domain change) is re-subscribed silently, unless alerts were turned off on purpose.
- Files: `public/admin-extras.js`, `tests/order-push.test.js`.
- PR: https://github.com/uoakkarkyaw2002-commits/gearhub-industrial/pull/143
